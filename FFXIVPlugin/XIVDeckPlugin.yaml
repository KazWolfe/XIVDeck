  ***THIS PLUGIN IS IN THE PRERELEASE/TESTING PHASE. EXPECT BUGS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.***
  
  This plugin allows players to place virtually any hotbar-able action onto a Stream Deck, including hotbar slots 
  themselves. Actions are called directly, meaning no keybinds or awkward settings are necessary.
  
  Note that the XIVDeck Stream Deck plugin must also be installed for this plugin to be useful. You can download the
  Stream Deck plugin from the linked GitHub repository, under the "Releases" section.
  
  Please report all problems to KazWolfe in the Dalamud Support server or by opening an Issue on GitHub.
