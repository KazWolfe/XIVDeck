# Getting XIVDeck Support

XIVDeck offers support to its users through a few different mechanisms. Depending on what is needed, certain
support options may be more helpful/faster than others.

### GitHub Issues

**Great For:** Bug Reports, Feature Requests

If you've found a bug or want to suggest a feature to me, GitHub issues are a great place to submit a trackable
ticket that I will get to... eventually. GitHub Issues allow me to quickly find and reference various things,
and are therefore my preferred mechanism to receive these types of reports.

### XIVLauncher Discord

**Great For:** Technical Support

I am available for live support in the [XIVLauncher Discord](https://discord.gg/holdshift). Simply ask your
question in the appropriate channel:

* Submit any bug reports or general use questions to the `#plugin-issues-help` Discord channel.
  * If using the testing release, please use `#plugin-testing` instead.
* Submit any feature requests to `#plugin-suggestions`.

Feel free to ping me as well, I am generally relatively responsive to that server.

### Dalamud Feedback

I also accept feedback (bug reports and feature requests) directly from Dalamud's Plugin Installer. If you run
into a bug, I ask that you *please* provide contact information and send an error trace.

I cannot accept technical support questions over the Dalamud Feedback channel.
